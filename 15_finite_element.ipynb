    "The Finite Element Method (FEM) provides yet another method of transforming continuous PDE's to systems of discrete linear and non-linear equations and is particularly popular in Engineering and Solid Mechanics (although the method is completely general).  Finite Elements has a rich mathematical basis in functional analysis as well a very wide range of specialized applications.  Needless to say, this subject and the accompanying literature is vast.  The purpose of these notes are just to give you a very basic introduction to some of the fundamental ideas in Finite Elements and their implementation."

In this case we just subsitute $\\alpha$ for the gradient in the term above which is now only a function of the test function $v$ and get's evaluated and added to the load vector.\n",

The cleanest way is to note that if the boundary is of known value,  that degree of freedom is not really in the function space and we just solve starting with the first interior point and adjust the RHS as necessary. However when reconstructing the function we need to remember to insert the proper value on the boundaries.\n",
